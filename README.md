# Reference: https://www.datascience2000.in/2021/11/face-mask-detection-using-cnn.html

I refer to the blog above to implement a face mask detection using CNN.

This project will detect your face with a mask or without mask. If the mask is on your face then it’ll give a result “Mask” and if the mask is not on your face then it’ll give “No Mask”. 

I have trained my face mask detection model on a dataset and after training, I got 96.898% validation accuracy.
